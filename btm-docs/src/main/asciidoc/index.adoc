= Bitronix Transaction Manager

[IMPORTANT]
====
After more than a decade of inactivity, **Bitronix Transaction Manager** has
been actively revived and modernized. Significant updates have been introduced
to the codebase, but the documentation has not yet caught up. Portions of this
guide may be outdated or incomplete. A comprehensive documentation refresh is
currently in progress.
====

The Bitronix Transaction Manager (BTM) is a simple but complete implementation
of the Jakarta JTA 2.0 API. It is a fully working XA transaction manager that
provides all services required by the JTA API while trying to keep the code as
simple as possible for easier understanding of the XA semantics.
     
**THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE BTM PROJECT IS TO MAKE JTA A COMMODITY**

This is BTM's strongest point compared to its competitors: it is trivial to
configure and when something goes wrong it is much easier to figure out what to
do thanks to the great care placed in useful error reporting and logging.
