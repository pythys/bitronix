# Bitronix Transaction Manager (BTM)

Bitronix Transaction Manager (BTM) is a simple but complete implementation of
the Java Transaction API (JTA) 1.1. This eXtended Architecture (XA) transaction
manager provides all services required by the JTA while keeping the code as
simple as possible for easier understanding of XA semantics.
