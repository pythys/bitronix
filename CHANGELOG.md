All notable changes to **Bitronix Transaction Manager (BTM)** will be documented

and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [4.0.1] - 2026-01-10

### Summary

After more than a decade of inactivity, **Bitronix Transaction Manager** has
been revived and modernized. This release focuses heavily on simplifying the
codebase, removing obsolete bytecode manipulation layers, adopting Java 17+,
improving test stability, and bringing the build system and documentation into
the modern era. It also switched from JTA 1.1 to Jakarta JTA 2.0 and JMS 1.1 to
Jakarta JMS 3.1 both of which are **breaking changes**.

### Jakarta Migration

#### JTA Migration

Bitronix 4.0 upgrades the project from **JTA 1.1 (`javax.transaction`)** to
**Jakarta JTA 2.0.1 (`jakarta.transaction`)**. This is a **major breaking
change** that requires all consuming applications to migrate from the
`javax.transaction.*` namespace to the `jakarta.transaction.*` namespace.

- Most JTA classes moved to `jakarta.transaction.*` except for
  `javax.transaction.xa.*` which remains part of the JDK.
- The API surface remains the same; the breaking change is the mandatory
  **package rename** introduced by Jakarta EE.
- Applications still using `javax.transaction` **cannot** use bitronix 4.0
  without updating imports and dependencies.
  
#### JMS Migration

Bitronix 4.0 upgrades the project from **Genronimo JMS 1.1** to **Jakarta JMS
3.1.0**. This is a **major breaking change** that requires all consuming
applications to migrate from `javax.jms` to `jakarta.jms`.

#### Required Changes

1. Update Imports from `javax.transaction.*` to `jakarta.transaction.*` except
   for `javax.transaction.xa.*` which remains part of the JDK.

```patch
-import javax.transaction.UserTransaction;
-import javax.transaction.TransactionManager;
+import jakarta.transaction.UserTransaction;
+import jakarta.transaction.TransactionManager;
```

2. Update imports from `javax.jms.*` to `jakarta.jms.*`

3. Update Dependencies. For example:

```patch
-<dependency>
-    <groupId>javax.transaction</groupId>
-    <artifactId>jta</artifactId>
-    <version>1.1</version>
-</dependency>
+<dependency>
+    <groupId>jakarta.transaction</groupId>
+    <artifactId>jakarta.transaction-api</artifactId>
+    <version>2.0.1</version>
+</dependency>
```

```patch
-<dependency>
-    <groupId>org.apache.geronimo.specs</groupId>
-    <artifactId>geronimo-jms_1.1_spec</artifactId>
-    <version>1.1.1</version>
-</dependency>
+<dependency>
+    <groupId>jakarta.jms</groupId>
+    <artifactId>jakarta.jms-api</artifactId>
+    <version>3.1.0</version>
+</dependency>
```

### Added

- Integrated **Spotless** code formatting and linting to enforce consistent
  style across the codebase. Formatting rules are defined in `style.xml`.

### Changed

- **Set Java 17 as the minimum required JVM version.**
- Modernized reflection usage:
  - Replaced `Class.newInstance()` with
    `getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance()`.
  - Adopted auto-boxing (`Integer.valueOf()`, etc.) instead of obsolete
    constructors.
- Migrated build tooling to modern versions:
  - Maven Wrapper → **3.3.4** (Maven 3.9.11)
  - `maven-compiler-plugin` → **3.11.0**
  - `maven-surefire-plugin` → **3.5.4**
  - `maven-javadoc-plugin` → **3.12.0**
  - `maven-bundle-plugin` → **6.0.0**
  - `asciidoctor-maven-plugin` → **3.2.0**
- Updated project metadata to reflect the new GitHub organization.
- Improved `JdbcPoolTest` by replacing fragile string parsing with proper JDBC
  API usage.
- Disabled Javadoc doclint for compatibility with older comments.
- Replaced Mockito deprecated APIs with modern `ArgumentMatchers` equivalents.
- Initial work done on documentation to get it up to date with codebase changes.

### Removed

- **Removed Javassist and all related proxy implementation code.**
- **Removed CGLIB and all related proxy implementation code.**
- **Removed CORBA rmi obsolete implementation**
- **Removed OSGI obsolete implementation**
- The `"auto"` proxy-factory detection logic was simplified; Java Proxy is now
  the only mechanism.
- **Removed the entire `btm-spring` module**, because:
  - It used ancient Spring 2.x XML-based APIs incompatible with modern Spring.
  - It depended on CGLIB and fails on Java 17+.
  - Modern Spring usage requires only a few lines of configuration without this
    module.
- **Removed all obsolete lifecycle modules for jetty and tomcat**
- **Removed all bitronix/tm/resource/ehcache files**
- **Removed the deprecated maven-release-plugin.**
- **Removed GitHub CI workflow** that targeted outdated Java toolchains and
  Maven versions.
- **Removed JDBC overlay JAR files** (deprecated and unused).
- Cleaned up `.gitattributes` and `.gitignore`.

### Upgraded

- Mockito from **1.8.5 → 5.20.0** (`mockito-all` replaced with `mockito-core`).
- JUnit from **4.8.2 → 4.13.2**.
- Numerous dependencies and plugins updated to modern, maintained versions.

### Notes

- This release intentionally removes legacy subsystems that were unmaintained
  for 10+ years.
- Users relying on proxy customization (CGLIB/Javassist) should migrate to Java
  Proxy or contribute alternative extension points.
- The legacy `btm-dist` module has been **removed**.  
  It previously contained Ant-based distribution scripts and dozens of
  hand-maintained release-notes text files.  
  These notes have now been consolidated into this unified `CHANGELOG.md`.
- All historical release notes from 2006–2014 were preserved and merged here to
  maintain project history in a modern, accessible format.
